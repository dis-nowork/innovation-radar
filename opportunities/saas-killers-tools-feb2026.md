# SaaS Killers & Developer Tools — Fev 2026

## 334. PhialsBasement/LibreCrawl ⭐ 414
**Link:** https://github.com/PhialsBasement/LibreCrawl
**Categoria:** SEO/Marketing

### Problema Real
Screaming Frog costs $259/year. Sitebulb costs $150+/year. DeepCrawl costs thousands. Every SEO professional needs a crawler, but the market is dominated by expensive desktop apps. LibreCrawl is web-based, multi-tenant, free.

### Eixos de Inovação
- 🎯 **Problema real:** SEO professionals and agencies pay $259-5000+/year for crawling tools
- 💸 **Custo:** 100% free vs. $259+/year incumbents
- 🚀 **Escala:** Multi-tenant web-based = can serve agencies with many clients simultaneously

### TAM
- SEO tools market: $7B+ (Ahrefs, Semrush, Moz, Screaming Frog)
- 5M+ SEO professionals worldwide

### Modelo de Negócio
- **Managed cloud crawling** (pay per crawl, avoid infra headaches)
- **Agency tier** with white-label, client management, scheduled crawls
- **API access** for programmatic SEO auditing
- **Plugin marketplace** (custom extractors, integrations)

### Esforço: Médio
Core works but needs polish for enterprise — scheduled crawls, historical comparisons, better visualizations.

### Combinações
- Com Notifuse (#303) = SEO crawler → find issues → email reports automatically
- Com HeyForm (#61) = embedded lead gen forms on SEO audit reports

## 335. dadbodgeoff/drift ⭐ 623
**Link:** https://github.com/dadbodgeoff/drift
**Categoria:** DevTools/AI Context

### Problema Real
AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md files go stale instantly. Developers manually maintain context files for AI assistants that become outdated the moment code changes. Drift **auto-detects** patterns and conventions from your actual code, maintaining living memory.

### Eixos de Inovação
- 🎯 **Problema real:** AI coding assistants need codebase context, but static files are always stale
- 💎 **Qualidade:** Auto-discovers patterns with confidence scoring, call graph analysis, test topology mapping
- ⚡ **Velocidade:** `drift setup` in 30 seconds scans entire codebase

### TAM
- Developer tools: $25B+ market
- Every dev using AI assistants (50M+) needs better context

### Modelo de Negócio
- **Team/Enterprise tier** with shared pattern libraries, team conventions
- **CI/CD integration** (enforce patterns on PRs)
- **IDE plugin** (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- **Platform play** — become the "convention layer" between codebases and AI

### Esforço: Baixo-Médio
CLI works, MCP server works. Needs team features, cloud sync, analytics.

### Combinações
- Com Strix (#300) = drift detects patterns → strix tests against them for security
- Com GrepAI = semantic search + pattern awareness = ultimate codebase understanding

## 336. ronitsingh10/FineTune ⭐ 2.0k
**Link:** https://github.com/ronitsingh10/FineTune
**Categoria:** macOS/Audio

### Problema Real
macOS has no built-in per-app volume control. SoundSource costs $39. FineTune provides per-app volume, multi-device output, audio routing, and 10-band EQ from the menu bar — for free.

### Eixos de Inovação
- 🎯 **Problema real:** macOS users need per-app audio control (meetings quiet, music loud)
- 💸 **Custo:** Free vs. SoundSource $39
- 💎 **Qualidade:** EQ, audio routing, multi-device — more features than the paid alternative

### TAM
- macOS utility apps: $2B+
- 100M+ Mac users, audio control is a universal need

### Modelo de Negócio
- **Pro features** (audio recording, advanced routing, presets marketplace)
- **Freemium desktop app** with premium plugins
- **Podcast/streaming toolkit** integration

### Esforço: Baixo
App is functional. macOS-only limits market but very sticky category.
